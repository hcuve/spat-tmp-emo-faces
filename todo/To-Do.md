## To-Do and improvements
- [ ] update the order of the figure numbers, currently fig 1 is the last one due to having moved methods last
- [ ] update figure 6 to include emotive speech not expressive speech
- [ ] Figure out why fills disappear in pdf version of the paper for figure 6 and 7, unless we save pdf for printing
- [ ] Continue saving and commenting rds files with the spoken NMF, then classification, then scripts for facial expression substates.
- [ ] consider moving exportedsets (mostly au to landmark data) to exported data
- [ ] Write a few wiki walkthroughs for different parts of the code to aid understanding and usage.

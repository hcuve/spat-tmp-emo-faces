## Repository Contents

All scripts related to the paper can be found in the `Paper` folder. The scripts are organised in the following order, which corresponds to the sequence of steps outlined in the manuscript:

1. **Pre-processing:** Scripts for processing OpenFace data, specifically for expression-only and emotive speech data.
2. **NMF Fitting:** Code to fit Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) models to learn the spatiotemporal structure based on AU (Action Unit) time series.
3. **Validation:** A series of validation steps to assess the NMF models.
4. **Feature Extraction:** Scripts to derive time series features from the spatiotemporal components.
5. **Supervised Classification:** Scripts for performing supervised classification analysis.
6. **Figures:** Scripts to generate the figures presented in the paper.
